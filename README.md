This project is a web-based visualization tool that displays the career goals of legendary soccer players. The project consists of three key components:

fetch_soccer_data.php: Fetches soccer player data from the database.

api.php: Serves as an API endpoint, exposing the data in JSON format for the frontend.

database.php: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.

The frontend uses this data to generate an interactive bar chart using Plotly.
